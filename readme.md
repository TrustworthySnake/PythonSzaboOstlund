# About
This program is a Python adaptation of the FORTRAN program included in the book "Modern Quantum Chemistry". It performs ab-initio Hartree-Fock calculations on diatomic molecules using 1s minimal STO-nG basis set (Szabo & Ostlund, 1996, pp. 419â€“436). Minor modifications have been made to the print statements and Python's built-in math functions are used. Currently, the program calculates the electronic and total energy for HeH<sup>+</sup> using an STO-3G basis set.
